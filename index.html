            <h1> Dream Big </h1>
            <h2> Become a web developer</h2>
            <p> I have this dream or a goal. Operation B2C wherein I would like to create a business model where I can
                turn the beggars in our country into working citizens. Giving poor people fridges, televisions,
                grinders, gold etc does not alleviate them from poverty (like how we do it in our state tamil nadu,
                india , but teaching them how to earn, sure does put them in the right way to go beyond surviving into
                living.
